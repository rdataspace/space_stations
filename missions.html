					<p>The first step is to launch the spacecraft and overcome the Earth's gravity so that it can be placed in a similar orbit to the station.</p>
					<p>The launching method varies depending on the size and type of craft being launched. All launch vehicles, however, use either liquid or solid fuelled rocket engines.</p>
					<p>The launch vehicles are also generally multi-staged. The first stage usually use a number of large engines to initially lift the weight of the spacecraft, launch vehicle and fuel.</p>

					<p>There are three main types of spacecraft missions to a station:</p>
						<ol>
							<li>Main Component Delivery - Placing station modules and structures into the required orbit.</li>
							<li>Station Crew Transport - Occupying the station with personnel.</li>
							<li>Supplies and Materials - For life support, station operation, maintenance and experiments.</li>
						</ol>

					<div class="barH3"><h3>1. Main Component Delivery</h3>
					</div>
					<h4 class="padt">Single Module Stations</h4>
					<p>Early space stations consisted of a single module which was launched, un-occupied, by a dedicated launcher rocket and used on-board engines to attain orbit. A combination automation and remote control was used to place it in the correct orbit.</p>

					<h4>Modular Stations</h4>
					<p>These stations contain a number of habitable modules and support structures which are assembled in orbit. This method is used when the design of the station is too large to be built on Earth and launched into orbit.</p>
					<p>Modular stations start with the launch of a core module using a method similar to single module stations. Additional major components, including modules and structures, are then added to the station. These are transported to the station by using dedicated launchers and engines or as cargo in other spacecraft.</p>
					<p>The U.S. Space Shuttle is the only craft, so far, capable of transporting large major components. Smaller components have also been transported using the U.S. SpaceX Dragon spacecraft.</p>
				</div>

				<!-- Right col -->

				<div class="rightCol">
					<div class="barH3"><h3>2. Station Crew Transport</h3>
					</div>
					<p class="padt">Space stations allow personnel to stay in space for longer periods than was possible using standard orbital spacecraft. These station crews need to be safely transported to the station and back to Earth.</p>
					<p>Station crew transport spacecraft are therefore based on the existing proven orbital craft. Early versions were simply modified to allow docking with the station, while later craft have been extensively modified for dedicated station use.</p>
					<p>Normally At least one crew transport craft remains docked at a station for use as an emergency escape vehicle. For longer duration missions, these need to be regularly replaced with a "fresh" craft of the same type.</p>

					<div class="barH3"><h3>3. Supplies and Materials</h3>
					</div>
					<p>Supplies include all those goods needed to provide life support for the crews and to operate and maintain the stations. Regular deliveries are required of consumables such as fuel, water, food, oxygen and spare parts.</p>
					<p>Most stations are also working research stations requiring specific equipment and the transport of experiment materials from and to the Earth.</p>
					<p>Small amounts of cargo can be transported to the stations with the crews. This was sufficient for the earlier short duration missions. As mission durations increased, dedicated cargo only craft were required for re-supply.</p>
					<p>The exception was the U.S. Space Shuttle which was large enough to carry crews and large amounts of supplies.</p>
